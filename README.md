# Pokemons app

Simple pokemons app. It contains table with pagination and filtering and detailed card page. It was a test task so since I had a tech task and a layout, I implemented some things based on them, and not on my own. In addition I decided to test here some new Angular features and GraphQL (it was in tech task too and to be honest this particular API is not the greatest one coz there are a lot of restrictions in it).

Unfortunately, the last Angular version isn't comparable to any of apollo-client versions so I couldn't try it out. But maybe in future I will be able to.

There is a lot of things to improve still and if I'll have time and wish I will fix it.
