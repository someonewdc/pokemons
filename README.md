# Pokemons app

Simple pokemons app. It contains table with pagination and filtering and detailed card page. It was a test task so I decided to test here some new Angular features and GraphQL. 

Unfortunately, the last Angular version isn't comparable to any of apollo-client versions so I couldn't try it out. But maybe in future I will be able to.

There is a lot of things to improve still and if I'll have time and wish I will fix it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
